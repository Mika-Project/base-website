# base-website

After cloning the repo make sure to run these commands before you're able to open the website.

```
npm install
composer install
```

After that rename the ".env.example" to ".env"
Then you can run the site with these 2 commands (you'll need to run them both)

```
php artisan serve
npm run dev
```
